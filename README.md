# CentOS - Parasoft Virtualize Server

This set up based on the [centos:latest](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/centos/) from the [Docker registery](https://registry.hub.docker.com/)

**Warning**: This set up requires the file _parasoft_virtualize_9.8_linux_x86_64.tar.gz_ this file is not yet directly provided. This hopefully will change soon.

**Warning**: The Virtualize Server still requires a LICENSE file!
